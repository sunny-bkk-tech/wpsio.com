## üîç Check for Common Blocking Issues

### Issue 1: Server Response Time

Test your server speed:
```bash
curl -w "@-" -o /dev/null -s https://www.wpsio.com << 'EOF'
    time_namelookup:  %{time_namelookup}s\n
       time_connect:  %{time_connect}s\n
    time_appconnect:  %{time_appconnect}s\n
      time_redirect:  %{time_redirect}s\n
   time_pretransfer:  %{time_pretransfer}s\n
 time_starttransfer:  %{time_starttransfer}s\n
                    ----------\n
         time_total:  %{time_total}s\n
EOF
```

**Bing Requirement:** Server response time < 3 seconds  
**If slow:** Optimize server, enable caching, use CDN

curl -I https://www.wpsio.com
```

**Required:** Look for `HTTP/2 200` or `HTTP/1.1 200` with valid SSL
