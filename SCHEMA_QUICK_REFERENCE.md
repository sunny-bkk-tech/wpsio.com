## 🔧 Two Implementation Options

### Option A: External JSON (Current Setup) ✅

**In `index.html` line 27:**
```html
<script type="application/ld+json" src="/schema.json"></script>
```

**Pros:** Clean, maintainable  
**Cons:** May not be loaded by all crawlers

---

### Option B: Inline JSON (RECOMMENDED) 🌟

**Replace line 27 with content from:**
`/public/schema-inline.html`

**Pros:** Better crawler compatibility  
**Cons:** Longer HTML file

**To implement:**
1. Open `/public/schema-inline.html`
2. Copy the entire `<script>` block
3. Replace line 27 in `index.html` with that block
