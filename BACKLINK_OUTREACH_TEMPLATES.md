Hi [Name],

I recently came across your excellent resource page: [URL]

I noticed you've listed some great Microsoft Office alternatives like [Competitor 1] and [Competitor 2]. I thought you might consider adding WPS Office, which has become a popular choice for users seeking a free alternative.

**Why WPS Office Stands Out:**
- Completely free (unlike many alternatives with limited free tiers)
- Used by 500+ million people globally
- 100% compatible with Microsoft Office file formats
- Available on all major platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, mobile)
- Highly rated (4.6/5 stars from 12,000+ reviews)

**Relevant Links:**
- Main site: https://www.wpsio.com
- Download page: https://www.wpsio.com/download
- Comparison guide: https://www.wpsio.com/wps-vs-microsoft-office

Your readers searching for free office software would definitely benefit from knowing about this option.

Would you consider adding WPS Office to your list? Happy to provide additional details or screenshots if helpful.

Thanks for curating such a valuable resource!
